### Backend Setup
1. Go to the `backend` folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file (see `.env` sample):
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=8000
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### Frontend Setup

   ```sh
   cd frontend/expense-tracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will run on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Environment Variables
- Set `CLIENT_URL` in your backend `.env` to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
- Set `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` as needed.
